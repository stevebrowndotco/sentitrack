Welcome to Sentitrack!

Sentitrack is a tool that queries the twitter streaming api for any give topic, username, or hashtag to discover the sentiment in real time.
Each tweet is analysed through the ANEW dataset, which is research data that measures the sentiment of words in the english dictionary.
The average of all of the words in the tweet is measured, and the average results over a period of time are plotted on a graph so you can see the sentiment in real time.

It works. I plan to be getting a demo up soon. Stay tuned!
