#Welcome to Sentitrack!

Sentitrack is a tool that queries the twitter streaming api for any give topic, username, or hashtag to discover the sentiment in real time.
Each tweet is analysed through the ANEW dataset, which is research data that measures the sentiment of words in the english dictionary.
The average of all of the words in the tweet is measured, and the average results over a period of time are plotted on a graph so you can see the sentiment in real time.

For the past month I’ve been researching how to visualise happiness on a geographical scale.
I’ve been working on a system that tracks UK sentiment in real time.
I collect and analyse thousands of data points across the UK from a server in Chicago in real time, and return the average result and plot it onto a graph every ten minutes.
The ‘happiness’ of the UK is measured on a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 is ‘not happy’ and 9 being ‘happiest possible’.

It works. I plan to be getting a demo up soon. Stay tuned!
